# Sentimental-Analysis

## Project Description
This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a critical sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our aim is to classify social media content, such as tweets, reviews, and comments, into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This involves extensive data mining from sources like Sentiment140 and other open-source datasets, as well as data collected directly from social media using tools like TWINT.

## Data
We utilize datasets like Sentiment140, which comprises 1.6 million tweets classified from 0 (negative) to 4 (positive), and our custom dataset derived from Twitter using the TWINT tool. The main attributes in these datasets include tweet text and sentiment labels.

## Technology
Python: For all backend and NLP processing.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): An essential library for NLP operations.

TWINT: For scraping tweets without Twitter Developer API limitations.

## Features
Data Analysis: Exploration of data attributes like tweet text length, word frequency, and sentiment classification.

Sentiment Classification: Using various machine learning models to classify sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral.

Data Visualization: Visual representations of data distributions, word frequencies, and model performances.
